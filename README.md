## Concept of the project:
The ANNAPOORNA website aims to raise awareness about hunger issues around India,
providing resources to those in need and encouraging community involvement through
donations and volunteer opportunities alongside educational content on sustainable
agriculture and diseases like malnutrition. The website plans on achieving this by acting
as a intermediary platform between volunteers, NGOâ€™s and needy.
## Problem Statement:
Despite being a major agricultural powerhouse of the world hunger remains a
significant issue in India. India is ranked 107 out of 121 in global hunger index and
approximately 190 million [14%] of population out of 1.4 billion is undernourished.

## Vision:
A world where everyone, everywhere, has access to safe, nutritious, and
sufficient food all year round. We envision a future free from hunger and
malnutrition, where food systems are sustainable and resilient, and where
all people have the dignity and opportunity to thrive.
